<p>L{A}ove of my life - you've h{F#m}urt me<br/>

Don't t{G}ake it aw{D}ay from me, bec{G}ause {D}you d{Hm}on't kn{E7}ow<br/>
Wh{A}at it means t{D}o me</p>

<p>Love of my life don't leave me<br/>
You've taken my love, (all of my love) and now desert me<br/>
Love of my life can't you see<br/>

Don't take it away from me (take it away from me)<br/>
Because you don't know (ooh ooh ooh know means to me)<br/>

How {Em}I still l{A}ove you - (i still love you){F}</p>

<p>Ooh, back - hurry back<br/>
Please bring it back home to me<br/>
Because you don't know what it means to me<br/>
Love of my life<br/>
Love of my life<br/>
Ooh, ooh</p>
